Project Overview:

The goal of this Tableau dashboard project is to analyze India's air pollution levels using historical daily ambient air quality data. The dataset, sourced from the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India, covers various states and cities across multiple years. The project aims to explore the relationship between air quality changes and environmental policy shifts in India.

Dashboard Components:

Map Visualization:

Utilizes geographical maps to display air quality levels across different states or regions in India.
Map markers are color-coded based on the Air Quality Index (AQI) or other relevant metrics.

Time Series Charts:

Features time series line charts illustrating changes in air quality over the years.
Data is grouped by months or years to identify patterns and trends.

Policy Change Timeline:

Integrates a timeline component showcasing key environmental policy changes in India.
Highlights policy change events on the timeline to observe correlations with air quality variations.

Filter Options:

Implements filters for users to select specific states, periods, or pollutant types.
Allows users to customize views based on their interests or research questions.

Comparative Analysis:

Includes comparative charts illustrating air quality comparisons between different states or regions.
Utilizes bar charts or line charts to illustrate variations in air quality metrics.

Top Pollutant Analysis:

Identifies and displays the top pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
Utilizes bar charts or pie charts to represent the proportion of each pollutant.

Insightful Annotations:

Uses annotations to highlight specific data points, events, or trends in the analysis.
Provides context and explanations for these annotations.

Dataset Overview:

Dimensions include Stn_code, Sampling_Date, State, Location, Agency, location_monitoring_station, pm2_5, Date, and Type.
Measures include So2 (Sulfur Dioxide), No2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), Rspm (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter), and Spm (Suspended Particulate Matter).

Air Quality Measurements:

SO2 and NO2 are dangerous outdoor air pollutants, contributing to respiratory symptoms and infections.
RSPM and SPM are produced from combustion processes, vehicles, and industrial sources.


Steps to Build the Dashboard:

Connect to Data: Open Tableau, connect to the provided dataset.
Design Dashboard Layout: Plan the layout to accommodate map, charts, timeline, and filters.
Create Worksheets: Develop individual worksheets for map, time series, comparative analysis, and pollutant analysis.
Apply Filters: Implement filters for user customization.
Implement Interactivity: Ensure all components interact seamlessly.
Timeline Integration: Add a timeline highlighting key policy changes.
Map Integration: Create a map visualization with color-coded markers.
Test and Refine: Validate functionality, adjust visualizations, and refine as needed.
Document Insights: Add annotations, explanations, and context to highlight key findings.
Publish and Share: Save, publish, and share the finalized Tableau dashboard.
