**Project 2 :**

Frog Leap Puzzle Game :
Developed a captivating puzzle game where players navigate a frog across a grid-like environment, aiming to leap from the left to the right edge strategically. The game offers an engaging challenge by allowing players to control frog movement using keyboard inputs. The objective is to solve the puzzle by moving the frogs while adhering to specific rules and constraints. Implemented on Google Colab, the game displays a visual grid with green and brown frogs, creating an immersive experience for players to enjoy. Explore multiple levels and potential enhancements to elevate the gameplay and make it more intriguing. üïπÔ∏èüçÉ
